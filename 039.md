# Starting timestamp can be bypassed by calling `settle`

## Summary
The starting timestamp set or still unset by the owner through the `start_auction` function can be bypassed by calling `settle`, which sends the first token to the fallback and then starts the auction for subsequent tokenIds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `start_auction` is meant to be used to start the auction process, after which the bids start getting accepted. However, this entire system can be bypassed by calling the `settle` function. This leads to the first tokenId being minted to the fallback address, and the next tokenId auction being started immediately.

This can be exploited in two scenarios,
1. The function `start_auction` hasn't been called yet
2. The function `start_auction` has been called, and the timestamp passed is a timestamp in the future

In both these cases, the auctions can be made to start immediately. Thus the two issues are clubbed together.

The function `settle` only checks for the timestamp using the statement
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L185
which is defined as
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L247-L252
This check passes if the current timestamp is after the end of the epoch, but also if the current timestamp is before the start of the auction, which is the main issue here.

Inside the `settle` function, it sets the start and end timestamps properly, which allows bids to be made for subsequent tokenIds.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L200-L206

So even if the starting timestamp is unset or set in the future, the checks in `settle` pass, and the function then proceeds to write the start and end timestamps to process bids correctly. 
## Impact
Bids can be started immediately. This goes against the design of the protocol.
## Code Snippet
The issue can be recreated with the following POC
```python
def test_ATTACK_settle_before_start(owner, house, nft):
    token_id = house.current_epoch_token_id()
    assert house.highest_bidder() == pytest.ZERO_ADDRESS
    house.settle()
    house.bid(house.current_epoch_token_id(), house.RESERVE_PRICE())
    assert house.current_epoch_token_id() == token_id + 1
    assert nft.ownerOf(token_id) == owner
```
This shows a case where `start_action` is never called, yet the bids start. The same can be done if `start_auction` is called with a timestamp in the future

## Recommendation
Change the check in `settle` to check for the end timestamp ONLY
```vyper
assert block.timestamp > self.epoch_end
```
