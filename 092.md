# There are a couple of potential vulnerabilities in liquidate function

## Summary
`liquidate` function did not check if the user's token balance was sufficient and valid to cover the `_token_id` being passed in as an argument, it also did not check if `shares_owned` was greater than zero before attempting to liquidate. For these why, it may result in reentrancy attack. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/Vault.vy#L320
There are no checking for the user's token balance is sufficient or insufficient, valid or invalid to cover the `_token_id` being passed in as an argument.  

If someone can create fake token and trick the contract into believing that he/she own it, then call the liquidate function with an invalid `_token_id`, causing the contract to try to liquidate a position that doesn't exist, leading to an error and the execution of the attacker's fallback function, allowing them to execute further code and potentially steal funds.

This code also does not check if the `position.shares_owned` is greater than zero before attempting to liquidate it.

## Impact
High

### Manual Review
Done

## Recommendation

1. Add proper checker if the token exists and valid 

2. Add checker if shares_owned is greater than zero

The above checkers must be execute before proceeding with the liquidation.
