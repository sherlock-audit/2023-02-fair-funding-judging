# `liquidate()` function is vulnerable to sandwich attack

## Summary

In `liquidate()` function, `IAlchemist(self.alchemist).liquidate` external call is made with the following code, but since `_min_amount_out` in this call is fixed number `1`, it is vulnerable to sandwich attack

```vyper
contracts/Vault.vy:
  364  
  365:     amount_shares_liquidated: uint256 = IAlchemist(self.alchemist).liquidate(
  366:         ALCX_YVWETH,                 # _yield_token: address,
  367:         shares_to_liquidate,         # _shares: uint256,
  368:         1                            # _min_amount_out: uint256 -> covered by _min_weth_out
  369:     )

```
## Vulnerability Detail

Function `liquidate()` is called in every liquidate in Vault contract.
Liquidates the underlying debt of position[_token_id] by burning a corresponding amount of shares. Withdraws remaining value of shares as WETH to token_owner. Reverts if owner would receive less than _min_weth_out.


However `amount_shares_liquidated:` always has the value 1 when called by `liquidate` function.


The `liquidate()`method has the  `_min_weth_out` parameter, which basically serves as the slippage tolerance parameter. The problem is that everywhere in the code where `amount_shares_liquidated` is called, the value of `_min_amount_out` is just 1 wei, which basically means all swaps executed in the compound method can be sandwiched and the user can lose a huge amount of value due to slippage.

## Recommendation
Add a setter to dynamically configure slippage tolerance amounts on-chain, or always make sure all transactions go through a private/dark mempool
