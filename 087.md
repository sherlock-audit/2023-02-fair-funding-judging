# Vault#migrate isn't able to do anything because it lacks any kind of approvals to migrator

## Summary

Vault#migrate is designed to somehow migrate the position of the vault somewhere new. The problem is that the migrator is never approve to move any tokens on behalf of Vault. The result is that calling migrator#migrate can't actually do anything with any of the Vault's tokens. In a scenario that the vault needs to be migrated it will likely result in all user funds becoming locked and unrecoverable.

    +   alchemist.approveBurn(self.migrator, max_value(uint256))
