# [H] Newly created positions can claim old claimable

## Summary

Newly created positions have a default value of `0` for `amount_claimed`, lead to an immediate value in `_claimable_for_token()`, that should be `0`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_claimable_for_token()` function is responsible for calculating the pending WETH for a given token_id. 

When a new position is created, its `amount_claimed` default value is `0`, If the `amount_claimable_per_share` has a value, then the `_claimable_for_token` function of the new position will immediately have a value. 

This is because the calculation of `_claimable_for_token` is based on `total_claimable_for_position` - `position.amount_claimed`, where `total_claimable_for_position` is derived from the multiplication of the `shares_owned` of the position and the current `amount_claimable_per_share`. As the `shares_owned` of the new position are not zero, the `_claimable_for_token` will have a value immediately.


## Impact

if a new position owner claims this amount, the protocol will not have enough funds to pay the original investors' rewards, and some claim transactions will fail due to insufficient funds.

## Recommendation

One possible solution is to add a new storage variable `last_amount_claimable_per_share` in the Position.

Then, in the `register_deposit` function, check if `position.last_amount_claimable_per_share` is `0`. If so, set `position.last_amount_claimable_per_share` to `self.amount_claimable_per_share`. 

Finally, modify the `_claimable_for_token` function.

The modified code snippets for these changes are as follows:

```vyper
struct Position:
    token_id: uint256
    amount_deposited: uint256
    shares_owned: uint256
    amount_claimed: uint256

    last_amount_claimable_per_share: uint256  # new storage variable

    total_claimable_for_position: uint256 = position.shares_owned * diff_claimable_per_share / PRECISION  # calculate claimable based on the difference between current and last amounts
