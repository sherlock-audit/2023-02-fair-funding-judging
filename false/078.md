# `FALLBACK_RECEIVER` is an important address and should be changeable to prevent possible lose

## Summary

`FALLBACK_RECEIVER` is an important address and should be changeable to prevent possible lose

## Vulnerability Detail

In `AuctionHouse.vy` the `FALLBACK_RECEIVER` address is used if there are no bids during an epoch to mint the NFT to it. 

This address is only checked to not be 0 address
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L116

and is declared as immutable `FALLBACK_RECEIVER: public(immutable(address))` meaning that if a wrong address is set here, it cannot be change.

Such an important address needs to be changeable in case of typos/mistakes when first setting it.

## Impact

Because the address is used to send NFTs that are not bided on during the auction, if a wrong address is set, any such NFT will be lost. These NFTs have specific roles in the protocol ecosystem, that benefits user. Even if in the possession of the protocol (if no bidder) they could still be used after by the protocol during other campaigns.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make `FALLBACK_RECEIVER` a normal, public, address and create a setter for it, executable only by the owner. Also send an event when the change is executed. Example implementation:

```Python
diff --git a/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy b/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy
