# [H] Not update `amount_claimed` when deposit to existing positions lead to `claimable_for_token` incorrect increased

## Summary

the `amount_claimed` variable in a position is not properly updated when an existing position is deposit with additional funds. This can lead to incorrect calculation of `_claimable_for_token` for the affected position.

## Vulnerability Detail

When an existing position is deposit, the corresponding `shares_owned` value in the Position is correctly increased, but the `amount_claimed` value is not updated to reflect the additional funds. 

This means that the calculation in the `_claimable_for_token` function will be incorrect, as it is based on the `shares_owned` multiplied by the `amount_claimable_per_share`, minus the `amount_claimed`. Since the `amount_claimed` value remains the same after deposit, the calculated `_claimable_for_token` value will be higher than it should be.

## Impact

This vulnerability could result in an incorrect increase in the `_claimable_for_token` value for existing positions that are topped up. it could lead to insufficient funds being available to cover claims, which could result in failed transactions for some token holders.

## Recommendation

updating the `amount_claimed` value in the Position when existing positions are deposit, to ensure that the calculated `_claimable_for_token` value is correct. 

This can be done by adjusting the `amount_claimed` value by the same proportion as the increase in the `shares_owned` value, so that the calculated `_claimable_for_token` value remains consistent.

Or add a new storage variable `last_amount_claimable_per_share` in the Position, and add `claim` before add `shares_issued` to `position.shares_owned` when deposit to existing position. see `Recommendation` in other issue.
