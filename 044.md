# amount_claimable_per_share accounting is broken and will result in vault insolvency

## Summary

Claim accounting is incorrect if there is a deposit when amount_claimable_per_share !=0, because position.amount_claimed isn't initialized when the deposit is created.

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating the amount of WETH to claim for a user, the contract simply multiplies the share count by the current amount_claimable_per_share and then subtracts the amount that has already been paid out to that token holder. This is problematic for deposits that happen when amount_claimable_per_share != 0 because they will be eligible to claim WETH immediately as if they had been part of the vault since amount_claimable_per_share != 0.

Example;
User A deposits 1 ETH and receives 1 share. Over time the loan pays itself back and claim is able to withdraw 0.1 WETH. This causes amount_claimable_per_share = 0.1. Now User B deposits 1 ETH and receives 1 share. They can immediately call claim which yields them 0.1 WETH (1 * 0.1 - 0). This causes the contract to over-commit the amount of WETH to payout since it now owes a total of 0.2 WETH (0.1 ETH to each depositor) but only has 0.1 WETH.

## Impact

Contract will become insolvent

## Recommendation

position.amountClaimed needs to be initialized when a deposit is made:
      
        # deposit WETH to Alchemix
        shares_issued: uint256 = self._deposit_to_alchemist(_amount)
        position.shares_owned += shares_issued
    +   position.amount_claimed += shares_issued * amount_claimable_per_share
        self.total_shares += shares_issued
        
        self.positions[_token_id] = position
