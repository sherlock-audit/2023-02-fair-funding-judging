# Liquidation may fail due to insufficient share

## Summary
When call function ```withdraw_underlying_to_claim()```  to withdraw WETH from Alchemix to be distributed ,the reduced share is not updated on the variable ```total_shares``` resulting in liquidating debt fail.
## Vulnerability Detail

```
The function ```liquidate()``` allows the owner of NFT to liquidate the underlying debt of position[_token_id] by burning a corresponding amount of shares.
The function ```withdraw_underlying_to_claim()``` is used to withdraw WETH from Alchemix to be distributed.It will burn shares to get WETH. However ,the reduced share is not updated on the variable ```total_shares```. The value of the variable ```total_shares```  is more than the share recorded in the alchemist protocol.If a large number of users liquidate their assets, there may not be enough share to burn, causing the transaction to fail

## Impact
If a large number of users liquidate their assets, there may not be enough share to burn, causing the transaction to fail
