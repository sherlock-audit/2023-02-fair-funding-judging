# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721

## Summary
Use `safeMint` instead of `mint` to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail
If address `to` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in the contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:
*A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.*

## Impact
Broke the EIP 721, possible lost of NFTs

## Code Snippet
[MintableERC721.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/solidity/MintableERC721.sol#L16)
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, tokenId);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeMint instead of mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
When using a `_safeMint()`  add `nonReentrant` modifier because `_safeMint` is a callback function.
