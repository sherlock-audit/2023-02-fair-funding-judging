# NFTs can get stuck in contracts that don't support ERC-721

## Summary

NFTs can get stuck in contracts that don't support ERC-721

## Vulnerability Detail

If the NFT is minted to a contract that doesn't support ERC-721, it will be frozen in the contract.
This is because of the use of `mint` instead of `safemint`

## Impact

Bidders would lose their NFTs

## Recommendation

Use `safemint` instead of `mint` to check received address support for ERC721 implementation.
