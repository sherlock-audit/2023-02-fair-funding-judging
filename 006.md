# No NFTs can be minted after initial `max_token_id`

## Summary
Once the initial `max_token_id` has been reached, no NFTs can be minted even after raising the minting cap via `max_token_id`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Upon auction settlement, the round setup is as follows:
```vyper
if self.current_epoch_token_id < self.max_token_id:
        self.current_epoch_token_id += 1
        self.epoch_start = block.timestamp
        self.epoch_end = self.epoch_start + EPOCH_LENGTH
else:
    self.epoch_start = 0
    self.epoch_end = 0
```

Notice how `current_epoch_token_id` isn't incremented in the case that `current_epoch_token_id == max_token_id` (I name this the final auction). This means that the lastest NFT token id to be minted will be `max_token_id`.

There is a function that allows the minting cap to be raised: `set_max_token_id()`. However, `current_epoch_token_id` will still be equal to the previous `max_token_id` still. Hence, upon auction settlement, the NFT will attempt to mint token id `max_token_id`, which reverts because it has already been minted.

## POC
```py
def test_settle_after_max_token_id_reached(house):
    # Step 0: Setup - Auction up to & inclusive of max_token_id
    house.start_auction(0)
    for i in range(house.current_epoch_token_id(), house.max_token_id() + 1):
        house.bid(house.current_epoch_token_id(), house.RESERVE_PRICE())
        timetravel(house.epoch_end() + 1)
        house.settle()

    # Step 1: Increase `max_token_id`, start new auction
    house.set_max_token_id(house.max_token_id() + 5)
    house.start_auction(0)

    # Step 2: Bid on current auction
    house.bid(house.current_epoch_token_id(), house.RESERVE_PRICE())
    timetravel(house.epoch_end() + 1)

   # Step 3: Settlement reverts
    with boa.reverts():
        house.settle()
```

## Impact
Given that the AuctionHouse will be given ownership (only NFT owner can mint), but has no capability to transfer ownership, no migration can be performed. Hence, no new NFTs can be minted once the initial `max_token_id` has been reached.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
At first glance, the fix might seem simple: increment `current_epoch_token_id()` in the else case too. However, this leads to another possible DoS: repeated settlement. Because `_epoch_in_progress()` will remain as `false` in the final auction, anyone can call `settle()` multiple times to repeatedly mint [`old_max_token_id`, `new_max_token_id`] to the `FALLBACK_RECEIVER`.

I've considered incrementing in `set_max_token_id`:
```diff
def set_max_token_id(_new_max_token_id: uint256):
    """
    @notice
        Changes the max_token_id and the amount of NFTs to be auctioned.
        Can only be called by owner.
    @param _new_max_token_id
        The last token id to be minted.
    """
    assert msg.sender == self.owner, "unauthorized"
-   assert _new_max_token_id >= self.current_epoch_token_id, "cannot set max < current"
+   # equality is excluded for the edge case handling below
+   assert _new_max_token_id > self.current_epoch_token_id, "cannot set max <= current"
   
+    # Increment current_epoch_token_id only when the old_max_token_id has been auctioned off and settled
+    if (self.max_token_id == self.current_epoch_token_id && self._epoch_in_progress() == False && self.epoch_end == 0)
+        self.current_epoch_token_id += 1

    self.max_token_id = _new_max_token_id
```
but you'd also have to atomically update the auction start time because `self._epoch_in_progress()` will remain `false`, allowing anyone to settle the first NFT of the new token batch (not that it'll benefit them, but still).

The fix is therefore non-trivial and requires substantial thought.
