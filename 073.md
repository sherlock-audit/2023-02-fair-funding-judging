# Audit Report

## Codebase Impressions
Not many projects use Vyper, so to be able to audit one is a privilege that I'm honoured to be given. The codebase seems simple:
- `AuctionHouse.vy`: auctioning off 1 NFT per day, similar to how nounsDAO does their daily auction. Raised funds from the highest bidder are sent to the vault.
- `Vault.vy`: Funds are deposited to Alchemix, and a 50% non-liquidatable, self-repaying loan is acquired and sent to help the target project as Fair Funding
- `MintableERC721.sol`: The NFT to be minted and auctioned off. NFT holder is given the right to recover the raised funds over time.

The AuctionHouse was clear and rather straightforward in its logic. The vault is where majority of the business logic bugs lie. In my opinion, it would've greatly benefitted from integration tests using Foundry + mainnet forking instead of mocking the Alchemix system. It would've caught the first depositor error, and writing various scenario tests would've helped ironed out some of the accounting issues I discovered.

## Low / Informational Issues

### Define interfaces for `AuctionHouse` & `Vault` for easy 3rd party integrations
Whilst setting up the Foundry + Vyper repo, I had to write out the solidity interfaces for the contracts. Think other parties / integrations would stand to benefit from having these interfaces. I'm sure they'll appreciate having to do less work!

### Owner can freely mint to `FALLBACK_RECEIVER`
Since the AuctionHouse owner is trusted, I consider this as a low issue, but it's an attack vector if the NFT collection becomes as valuable as nounsDAO. The owner can simply do `refund_highest_bidder()` -> `settle()` to freely mint the NFT to the fallback receiver for every NFT to be auctioned.

### Erroneous Event Emission
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L242
`Bid` is emitted in `start_auction`. Given that NFT id 0 is the first NFT to be auctioned, this bid event emission possibly will mess up analytics that rely on events. Best to remove it.

### `suggested_owner` not zeroed after ownership transferred
I  assume it’s a gas optimization to leave the slot dirty after ownership is claimed. No harm leaving it as the new owner, except that he can call `accept_ownership()` to spam event emissions of `OwnershipTransferred`. Maybe add an assert check:
```vyper
assert self.owner != self.suggested_owner, "same as current"
```

### Do not change `_mint()` to `safeMint()`
I know it’s mentioned in `MintableERC721.sol` that `_mint()`  is used instead of `safeMint()` to prevent auction DoS, but it'll be good to add the same comment in `AuctionHouse`. Note that `settle()` does NOT have reentrancy protection, so it is ***crucial*** that `_mint()` is used. Otherwise, one can re-enter through the `on_ERC721_received` hook to repeatedly call `settle()` to mint multiple NFTs.

In addition, consider adding reentrancy protection to `settle()`.

### Unclear `MintableERC721` Documentation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding-hickuphh3#mintableerc721
The documentation seems to suggest that `Vault` is the NFT owner, but in practice, it is the AuctionHouse. The `Vault` merely verifies the token holder to be the caller for the relevant functions.
