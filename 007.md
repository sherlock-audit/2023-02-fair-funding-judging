# `onlyOwner` Check Missing

## Summary
`AuctionHouse.settle()` should be an `onlyOwner` function 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AuctionHouse.settle()` is used to settle the auction and mint the MintableNFT to the winner's address.
The `MintableERC721.mint()` is `onlyOwner` function. That means only the owner can mint NFTs to the winner's address. 
So `msg.sender == owner` should be checked in the `AuctionHouse.settle()` as well and in the first place.

## Impact
Unexpected behavior can happen if external users call it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure that `AuctionHouse.settle()` is only owner callable:
```vyper
assert msg.sender == self.owner, "unauthorized"
```
