# Issue H-1: amount_claimable_per_share accounting is broken and will result in vault insolvency

## Summary

Claim accounting is incorrect if there is a deposit when amount_claimable_per_share !=0, because position.amount_claimed isn't initialized when the deposit is created.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/Vault.vy#L430-L440

When calculating the amount of WETH to claim for a user, the contract simply multiplies the share count by the current amount_claimable_per_share and then subtracts the amount that has already been paid out to that token holder. This is problematic for deposits that happen when amount_claimable_per_share != 0 because they will be eligible to claim WETH immediately as if they had been part of the vault since amount_claimable_per_share != 0.

Example;
User A deposits 1 ETH and receives 1 share. Over time the loan pays itself back and claim is able to withdraw 0.1 WETH. This causes amount_claimable_per_share = 0.1. Now User B deposits 1 ETH and receives 1 share. They can immediately call claim which yields them 0.1 WETH (1 * 0.1 - 0). This causes the contract to over-commit the amount of WETH to payout since it now owes a total of 0.2 WETH (0.1 ETH to each depositor) but only has 0.1 WETH.

## Impact

Contract will become insolvent

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

position.amountClaimed needs to be initialized when a deposit is made:
      
        # deposit WETH to Alchemix
        shares_issued: uint256 = self._deposit_to_alchemist(_amount)
        position.shares_owned += shares_issued
    +   position.amount_claimed += shares_issued * amount_claimable_per_share
        self.total_shares += shares_issued
        
        self.positions[_token_id] = position
        

## Discussion

**HickupHH3**

Dup of #114

**IAm0x52**

Escalate for 1 USDC

Not a dupe of #114. That focuses on depositing twice to the same token (which can't happen outside of admin abuse). The issue is that it generally applies to all deposits. Please re-read my example as to why this is an issue and how it leads to gross over-commitment of rewards.

Two reasons I disagree with this being low:
1) The argument that this will only be used for a short period and so "it doesn't have much impact" is a poor argument. This is meant as a general utility that anyone can use and they should be able to make a funding period as long as they want
2) This is a serious issue that will lead to rewards being over-committed and the vault WILL go insolvent as a result. The extra fees being paid will be taken from other users and will GUARANTEED cause loss of funds to other users.

Would like to add that this and #113 are the same issue and escalations should be resolved together.

You've created a valid escalation for 1 USDC!

To remove the escalation from consideration: Delete your comment.
To change the amount you've staked on this escalation: Edit your comment **(do not create a new comment)**.

You may delete or edit your escalation comment anytime before the 48-hour escalation window closes. After that, the escalation becomes final.

**HickupHH3**

Fix is ok: `total_claimable` is split amongst newly added shares as well (see issue #50), but I take it that it is an acceptable feature based on the resolution of the referenced issue.

I'd also like to highlight that some yield can be lost due to rounding, see example below.

### Example
`total_shares` = `0.49e18`
Assuming a yield of `0.0001` ETH has been accumulated and marked claimable so far,
`amount_claimable_per_share` = `0.0001e18 * 1e6 / 0.49e18` = `204`
`total_claimable` = `204 * 0.49e18` = `9.996e19`

Adding `new_shares` = `1.5e18`,
`amount_claimable_per_share` = `9.996e19 / (0.49e18 + 1.5e18)` = `50`
`total_claimable` = `50 * (0.49e18 + 1.5e18)` = `9.95e19`, which is a discrepancy of `(9.996e19 - 9.95e19) / 1e6` = `4.6e-7` ETH.

Probably negligible given low yield accumulation + short auction reasoning. Nevertheless, consider using a higher precision value. Edit: I see https://github.com/Unstoppable-DeFi/fair-funding/pull/2 does just that.

# Issue H-2: Incorrect shares accounting cause liquidations to fail in some cases 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding-judging/issues/38 

## Found by 
hickuphh3, jkoppel, Bauer, 0x52

## Summary
Accounting mismatch when marking claimable yield against the vault's shares may cause failing liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail
`withdraw_underlying_to_claim()` distributes `_amount_shares` worth of underlying tokens (WETH) to token holders. Note that this burns the shares held by the vault, but for accounting purposes, the `total_shares` variable isn't updated.

However, if a token holder chooses to liquidate his shares, his `shares_owned` are used entirely in both `alchemist.liquidate()` and `withdrawUnderlying()`. Because the contract no longer has fewer shares as a result of the yield distribution, the liquidation will fail.

## POC
Refer to the `testVaultLiquidationAfterRepayment()` test case below. Note that this requires a fix to be applied for #2 first.

## Tool used
Foundry, Mainnet Forking, Manual Review

## Recommendation
For the `shares_to_liquidate` and `amount_to_withdraw` variables, check against the vault's current shares and take the minimum of the 2.

The better fix would be to switch from marking yield claims with withdrawing WETH collateral to minting debt (alETH) tokens.

## Discussion

**Unstoppable-DeFi**

This is correct.

We need to use `total_shares` and `position.shares_owned` to calculate the percentage of a positions contributions and then multiply it with the `remaining_shares` to receive the correct amount of shares during liquidation.

**Unstoppable-DeFi**

https://github.com/Unstoppable-DeFi/fair-funding/pull/9

**HickupHH3**

Fix looks good - Proportional amount of shares to be liquidated now factors in the actual shares the vault holds:`position.shares_owned / self.total_shares * shares_in_vault` instead of only the position's owned shares.




# Issue M-1: Migrator contract lacks sufficient permissions over vault positions 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding-judging/issues/91 

## Found by 
hickuphh3, ABA, jkoppel, Ruhum, 0x52, minhtrng

## Summary
The migrator contract lacks sufficient permissions over vault shares to successfully perform migration.

## Vulnerability Detail
> Since vault potentially holds an Alchemix position over a long time during which changes at Alchemix could happen, the `migration_admin` has complete control over the vault and its position after giving depositors a 30 day window to liquidate (or transfer with a flashloan) their position if they're not comfortable with the migration.

We see that all that `migrate()` does is to trigger the `migrate()` function on the migration contract. However, no permissions over the vault's shares were given to the migration contract to enable it to say, liquidate to underlying or yield tokens. It also goes against what was intended, that is, _"complete control over the vault and its position"_.

```vyper
@external
def migrate():
    """
    @notice
        Calls migrate function on the set migrator contract.
        This is just in case there are severe changes in Alchemix that
        require a full migration of the existing position.
    """
    assert self.migration_active <= block.timestamp, "migration not active"
    assert self.migration_executed == False, "migration already executed"
    self.migration_executed = True
    Migrator(self.migrator).migrate()
```

## Impact
Funds / positions cannot be successfully migrated due to lacking permissions.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/Vault.vy#L545-L556

## Tool used

## Recommendation
In addition to invoking the `migrate()` function, consider calling `approveWithdraw()` on the migrator contract for all of the vault's shares.
https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/v2/docs/alchemistv2#approvewithdraw

Also consider using `raw_call()` for this function call because the current `alchemist` possibly reverts, bricking the migration process entirely.

This is correct, a `delegateCall` should have been used.

Will fix.

**Unstoppable-DeFi**

Fix looks good - `raw_call` used to perform `delegatecall` on the migrator contract, which can only be set by the migration admin.



# Issue M-2: Broken Operator Mechanism: Just 1 malicious / compromised operator can permanently break functionality 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding-judging/issues/46 

## Found by 
hickuphh3, 0xSmartContract, ABA, csanuragjain, weeeh\_, rvierdiiev

## Summary
Operator access control isn't sufficiently resilient against a malicious or compromised actor.

## Vulnerability Detail
I understand that we can assume all privileged roles to be trusted, but this is about the access control structure for the vault operators. The key thing here is that you can have multiple operators who can add or remove each other. As the saying goes, _"you are as strong as your weakest link"_, so all it required is for 1 malicious or compromised operator to permanently break protocol functionality, with no possible remediation as he's able to kick out all other honest operators, _including himself_

The vault operator can do the following:
1) Set the `alchemist` contract to any address (except null) of his choosing. He can therefore permanently brick the claiming and liquidation process, resulting in the permanent locking of token holders' funds in Alchemix.
2) Steal last auction funds. WETH approval is given to the `alchemist` contract every time `register_deposit` is called, and with the fact that anyone can settle the contract, the malicious operator is able to do the following atomically:
    - set the alchemist contract to a malicious implementation
       - contract returns a no-op + arbitrary `shares_issued` value when the `depositUnderlying()` function is called
    - settle the last auction (assuming it hasn't been)
    - pull auction funds from approval given
3) Do (1) and remove himself as an operator (ie. there are no longer any operators), permanently preventing any possible remediation.

## Impact
DoS / holding the users' funds hostage.

## Recommendation
Add an additional access control layer on top of operators: an `owner` that will be held by a multisig / DAO that's able to add / remove operators. 

## Discussion

https://github.com/Unstoppable-DeFi/fair-funding/pull/10

**HickupHH3**

Fix looks good:
- Introduced `owner` role with 2-step transfer process + event emissions
- `msg.sender` is the initial `owner`
- Operators can only be added / removed by `owner`

[Non-zero add check](https://github.com/Unstoppable-DeFi/fair-funding/blob/f13edd27eb54156473a83cfb143bb7132c4f39ef/contracts/Vault.vy#L612) isn't necessary IMO, since the zero add will then have to claim ownership. Can consider removing, but no harm leaving it either



# Issue M-3: Starting timestamp can be bypassed by calling `settle` 

Source: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding-judging/issues/39 

## Found by 
0xhacksmithh, XKET, HonorLt, ck, ABA, seyni, 0xlmanini, carrot, Bahurum, rvierdiiev, 7siech

## Summary
The starting timestamp set or still unset by the owner through the `start_auction` function can be bypassed by calling `settle`, which sends the first token to the fallback and then starts the auction for subsequent tokenIds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `start_auction` is meant to be used to start the auction process, after which the bids start getting accepted. However, this entire system can be bypassed by calling the `settle` function. This leads to the first tokenId being minted to the fallback address, and the next tokenId auction being started immediately.

This can be exploited in two scenarios,
1. The function `start_auction` hasn't been called yet
2. The function `start_auction` has been called, and the timestamp passed is a timestamp in the future

In both these cases, the auctions can be made to start immediately. Thus the two issues are clubbed together.

The function `settle` only checks for the timestamp using the statement
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L185
which is defined as
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L247-L252
This check passes if the current timestamp is after the end of the epoch, but also if the current timestamp is before the start of the auction, which is the main issue here.

Inside the `settle` function, it sets the start and end timestamps properly, which allows bids to be made for subsequent tokenIds.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-fair-funding/blob/main/fair-funding/contracts/AuctionHouse.vy#L200-L206

So even if the starting timestamp is unset or set in the future, the checks in `settle` pass, and the function then proceeds to write the start and end timestamps to process bids correctly. 
## Impact
Bids can be started immediately. This goes against the design of the protocol.
## Code Snippet
The issue can be recreated with the following POC
```python
def test_ATTACK_settle_before_start(owner, house, nft):
    token_id = house.current_epoch_token_id()
    assert house.highest_bidder() == pytest.ZERO_ADDRESS
    house.settle()
    house.bid(house.current_epoch_token_id(), house.RESERVE_PRICE())
    assert house.current_epoch_token_id() == token_id + 1
    assert nft.ownerOf(token_id) == owner
```
This shows a case where `start_action` is never called, yet the bids start. The same can be done if `start_auction` is called with a timestamp in the future
## Tool used
Boa
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the check in `settle` to check for the end timestamp ONLY
```vyper
assert block.timestamp > self.epoch_end
```

## Discussion

**hrishibhat**

While the issue is valid, there are no funds at risk with starting the auction early. 
Considering this issue a valid medium. 

**Unstoppable-DeFi**

https://github.com/Unstoppable-DeFi/fair-funding/pull/7

**HickupHH3**

Fix looks good:
- `auction_started` boolean flag is used to prevent `settle()` from being called before an auction begins
- auctions can now only be started once, and can never be restarted.
